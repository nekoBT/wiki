# FAQ

## General Questions
==- What is nekoBT?
nekoBT is a public torrent tracker for anime, with a focus on fansubs and groups.

We want to provide a place for fansubbers, encoders, and rippers to share their work with the community, whilst making it easier for users to find and download the content they want automatically.
===
==- Public and private download links? What does that mean?
If you are logged in, you will see two download options: public (blue) and private (purple).
- Public can be shared with anyone, and they will be able to access the torrent without needing an account.
- Private are only to be used by you, and are used to track your upload/download stats.
!!!danger
Do not share private links with anyone, as these contain your torrent key.<br>
Anyone with your torrent key can mess up your stats, and it could be seen as torrent cheating, which is a bannable offense.

## Account Questions
==- How can I change my username?
You cannot change your username. If you want to change it, you can contact staff, but it is not guaranteed that they will change it for you.
===
==- What is a recovery key?
A recovery key is a unique code that can be used to regain access to your account in case you forget your password or lose access to your authentication method.
Keep it safe and do not share it with anyone.
===
==- How do I change my password?
If you know your password, you can change it in your [account settings](https://nekobt.to/users/@me/edit).

If you don't know your password, you can reset it with your recovery key [here](https://nekobt.to/recovery).
===
==- What do I do if I'm locked out and don't have a recovery key?
If you forgot your password and don't have a recovery key, you can contact staff for help. However, they may not be able to help you if they can't verify that you own the account. One of the easiest ways for us to verify the account is yours is by you having another social account in your profile/group description.
