==- Public and private download links? What does that mean?
If you are logged in, you will see two download options: public (blue) and private (purple).
- Public can be shared with anyone, and they will be able to access the torrent without needing an account.
- Private are only to be used by you, and are used to track your upload/download stats.

Do not share private links with anyone, as these contain your torrent key.<br>
Anyone with your torrent key can mess up your stats, and it could be seen as torrent cheating, which is a bannable offense.
