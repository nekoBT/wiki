# Authorization

nekoBT authorizes users and bots with cookies, more specifically, the `ssid` cookie.

!!!danger
**Do not share your cookie or API key with people/programs/websites you don't trust.** It is a secret key that allows access to your account.
If you believe your API key has been compromised, you can revoke all API keys in your account settings.
!!!

!!!warning
It is against the rules to use your user `ssid` cookie to access the API programmatically. You must use an API key.<br>
If you are caught doing this, your account will be punished.
!!!

To obtain an API key:
1. Log in to nekoBT.
2. Go to your [account settings](https://nekobt.to/users/@me/edit).
3. Press `Generate` in the API Keys section.

Once you have an API key, you can use it to authenticate your requests to the API.
