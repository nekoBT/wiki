# Site Rules

Last Updated: 4 December 2025

!!!warning
This list is not exhaustive. Staff may decide that your actions negatively affect the site, without necessarily breaking a listed rule, and will punish your account accordingly.
!!!

1. No **spam, advertising, hateful content, harassment or trolling**. This includes but is not limited to:
   - Posting the same comment multiple times.
   - Excessive self-promotion.
   - Re-posting/bumping torrents.
   - Using slurs or derogatory language.
   - Harassing or bullying other users. (Criticism is allowed, but it must be constructive.)
   - Using the API to spam the site.
   - Automating actions without using an API key.
2. **Multiple accounts are strictly not allowed.**
3. No **malware, phishing or other malicious content**.
4. No **torrent hijacking**. Don't upload torrents that you didn't create, or that you don't have permission to upload. Always ask the original uploader first.
5. No **pornography, hentai or other NSFW content**. This includes NSFW links in comments, descriptions, etc, NSFW torrents, NSFW profile pictures. There is an exception for shows/movies that contains an uncensored version that is otherwise censored. **You must clearly mark the torrent as `UNCENSORED` in the title.**
6. Torrents should contain **anime only**. Live-action content is currently not allowed.
    - Anime is defined as having an entry on [AniDB](https://anidb.net/), [AniList](https://anilist.co/), or [MAL](https://myanimelist.net/).
7. Torrents **mustn't be zipped, or compressed in any way**.
8. No **watermarked content**, including ads, logos, or other branding. Crediting your fansub group is allowed, but it must be done in a way that doesn't obstruct the content.
9. Torrents must contain **accurate metadata** when uploading. You must ensure that:
    - The series/title matches the content.
    - The episode numbers are as correct as possible. If you are struggling to match the correct episode numbers, get as close as you can, and then edit the torrent to change what episodes are included.
    - The Video Type and Codec are correct.
    - The Sub Level is correct.
    - The Languages are correct.
    - Secondary Groups are included if applicable.
    - The MTL tag is used if the main subtitles are machine-translated.
10. **Torrent titles (except Romaji) must be in English**.
11. **No impersonation**. You aren't allowed to impersonate staff members, claim to be a staff member, or use well-known group names without permission of the group (even if they aren't registered on the site).
    - **Exception:** If a group is inactive and/or not contactable, you may use their tag and request a Staff Key to import their old torrents. You are not allowed to upload your own torrents under their tag. Staff may refuse and delete the group if they believe you have bad intent or don't have significant history on the site.
    - If the group becomes active again, you must transfer ownership of the group. Staff will assist with this process if needed (ex: hard to verify the real owner).  
12. **"Bad" video or audio quality is not allowed.** This is subjective. Torrents where the video or audio quality has been significantly degraded, due to poor encoding, are not allowed. Generally, don't do these, *just for the sake of it*:
    - No AI upscaling (like 1080p->4k, downscaling and rescaling is fine if you know what you're doing).
    - No Frame interpolation (increasing FPS. Exceptions are made for field interpolation required to properly deinterlace interlaced material).
    - No super-low-bitrate encodes (mini's are allowed, but don't cook it too hard).
13. **No leaked content.** Content that isn't officially released is not allowed. This also means **no CAM or Telesync releases.**
14. **No tracker cheating.** You are not allowed to manipulate your tracker stats in any way. This includes:
    - Using bots to download torrents you're seeding.
    - Sending fake upload/download stats to the tracker.
    - Using hacked torrent clients to manipulate your stats.
    - Using scripts to manipulate your stats.
    - Distributing your torrent key to others, or using someone else's torrent key.
15. **Multi-season/complete packs** are allowed, if the series has been completed, and there is no indication that the series will continue.
    - Packs containing both TV anime and movies are allowed, as long as you include all relevant content related to the series.
