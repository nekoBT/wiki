# Nyaa Linking & Importing

You can link you Nyaa account to your nekoBT account to prove ownership of your account, or to import old torrents from Nyaa.

### Linking Your Nyaa Account
You can link your Nyaa account to your nekoBT account [here](https://nekobt.to/nyaa/link).

Linking can be done in two ways:

Method | Description | Requires a Non-Anonymous Torrent
------ | ----------- | ----------------------
Torrent Verification | You will need to edit the description of a torrent you uploaded on Nyaa to include a unique verification code. Once done, nekoBT will check the torrent description to verify ownership. | ✅ (You can use an anonymous torrent and change it back after verification)
Cookie Verification | You will need to provide your Nyaa `session` cookie. nekoBT will use this to verify ownership of the account. | ❌



### Importing Torrents from Nyaa
You can import your old torrents from Nyaa to your nekoBT account [here](https://nekobt.to/nyaa/import).
