It's required to have 2 trackers, to act as a fallback in case one tracker goes down. We recommend at least 5 trackers for better availability.","If you want to upload to another public tracker as well (Nyaa, etc), you should add both trackers to the torrent file, as this will allow users to download from both trackers, increasing the number of peers/seeders available for everyone.
