These groups are shown in the contributors section.","You can add secondary groups when uploading a torrent, or edit the torrent later to add them.","You may also choose to add parent groups as secondary groups, if you are doing a joint release, however this is not strictly necessary.","By using secondary groups, it allows groups to see who has used their work, and makes finding muxes of other's work easier. For example, if Apple makes fansubs but they don't have dual audio, users looking for dual audio can search for torrents that contain Apple as a secondary group to find muxes that include their fansubs."]},{"l":"Permissions","p":["Groups have 4 levels of membership:","Contributor: Contributed to the group, but not necessarily a permanent member.

Example 1: If an episode has no songs, then you can count Song Styling as being done. Example 2: If an episode has no signs, then you can count TS as being done. However, just because an episode has no songs or signs, doesn't automatically make it L2. If you have done other jobs (TLC, QC, etc), then you can make it L2.","Level 0 (L0): Official subtitles","Level 1 (L1): Slight modifications","Level 2 (L2): Small-scale fansubs","Level 3 (L3): Full-scale fansubs","Level 4-9 (L4-L9): Batch releases","MUST be an original translation (OTL).","MUST have QC.","MUST meet L3 requirements.","Quality is slightly subjective, but it usually does not depend on the encode quality, as this is categorized by Video Type.","SHOULD contain batch fixes, such as typos, missing typesetting, etc.","SHOULD have all of the following: ED, TS, SS, fixed timing issues.","SHOULD have at least two of the following: ED, TS, and SS; or","Sub levels is how nekoBT attempts to categorize the quality of a release's subtitles. The higher the sub level, the more extensive the work put into the subtitles.","The keywords \"SHOULD\" and \"MUST\" below are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119.","The sub levels are as follows:","These are official subtitles taken from a source.","These levels are reserved for batch releases, and can only be awarded by staff.","To get L4+ on a release, report the torrent under the \"Request Level Increase for Batch\" category."]},{"l":"Appendix","p":["ED: Editing — making changes to the script to make it read well.","TS: Typesetting — turning foreign signs (text on screen) into your language.","QC: Quality Control — checking everyone's work for errors, typos, etc.","TLC: Translation Check — checking the translation for accuracy.","SS: Song Styling — adding styled lyrics for the songs(possibly with or without karaoke effects)","OTL: Original Translation — translation made from scratch for the project(rather than editing an existing one)"]}],[{"l":"Uploading"},{"l":"1.

Create a torrent file","p":["Next, you need to create a .torrent file for your release. We recommend mktorrent due to its simplicity and ease of use, but you can use any torrent creator you like, as long as it creates a valid torrent file.","Torrents need to contain at least 2 trackers, with one of them being our public tracker URL: https://tracker.nekobt.to/api/tracker/public/announce The other tracker can be any public tracker. It's required to have 2 trackers, to act as a fallback in case one tracker goes down.","If you want to upload to another public tracker as well (Nyaa, etc), you should add both trackers to the torrent file, as this will allow users to download from both trackers, increasing the number of peers/seeders available for everyone. This is called cross-seeding.","Do not include your private tracker link in the torrent file! This contains your torrent key used to identify you. If you include it, everyone will start messing up your stats, and in the worst case, it may be seen as tracker cheating, which is a bannable offense."]},{"l":"4.
